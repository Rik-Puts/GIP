# GIP
This is a project I made for school, it's a mini arcade machine with multiple games and a database to keep track of scores. It also has RFID with badges to recognize who's playing. And it has Flask so you can select what game you want to play online.

The files "colorsys.py" and "MFRC522.py" are just libraries that my program "GIP.py" needs to work.

If you want to see the project in action you can watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXBjgymEgLc
